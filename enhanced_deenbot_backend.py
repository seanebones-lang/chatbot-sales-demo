**1. Allah's Mercy in Times of Sorrow**
- Reference: Quran 2:286 - "Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear"
- Reference: Quran 94:5-6 - "For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease. Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease"
- Allah never gives us more than we can handle, and with every difficulty comes ease

- Hadith: Bukhari 1283 - "The Prophet (PBUH) said: 'The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, but we do not say anything except what pleases our Lord'"
- It's natural and acceptable to feel sadness and cry

**3. Islamic Coping Mechanisms:**
   **a) Prayer and Dua:**
   - Increase in prayer and supplication
   - Reference: Quran 2:186 - "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant"
   - Hadith: Tirmidhi 3371 - "Dua is the weapon of the believer"

   - Reference: Quran 2:155 - "And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient"
   - Hadith: Muslim 2999 - "How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one except the believer"

- **Reunion in Paradise:** Reference: Quran 3:185 - "Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection"

**6. Practical Steps:**
- **Daily Routine:** Maintain regular prayers and Quran recitation
- **Charity:** Help others in need (Sadaqah)
- **Exercise:** Physical activity helps with emotional well-being
- **Journaling:** Write down your feelings and gratitude

(O Allah, I seek refuge in You from anxiety and sorrow, weakness and laziness, miserliness and cowardice, the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men)

**Remember:** Your feelings are valid, and Allah sees your pain. With patience, prayer, and support, you will find strength and peace. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Allah is with the patient" (Bukhari 1469).""",
