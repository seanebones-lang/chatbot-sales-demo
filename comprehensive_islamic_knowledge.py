This approach allows you to focus deeply on each source and understand the nuances. Here's how to proceed:

**Next Source Available:**
[I'll show you the next most authentic source when you're ready]

**To continue:**
• Say "next source" or "show me the next one"
• Say "show me [specific collection]" (e.g., "show me Sahih Bukhari")
• Say "I'm ready for the next source"

**Benefits of this approach:**
• Better retention and understanding
• Time to reflect on each source
• Easier to compare and contrast
• More manageable information processing

        return """**All Additional Sources - Comprehensive Overview:**\n\n
I'll provide all remaining sources for comprehensive understanding. This gives you the complete picture but may be more information to process at once.

**To see all sources:**
• Say "show me all sources" or "give me everything"
• Say "comprehensive overview"

**Note:** This will include sources of varying authentication levels, so you can see the full spectrum of Islamic knowledge on this topic.

I understand you want to see sources from {source_name}. This is an excellent approach for focused study.

**To see {source_name} sources:**
• Say "show me {source_name} on [topic]"
• Say "give me {source_name} hadith"
• Say "what does {source_name} say about [topic]"

**Available Collections:**
• **Sahih Bukhari** - Most authentic collection
• **Sahih Muslim** - Second most authentic collection  
• **Abu Dawud** - Comprehensive sunnah collection
• **Tirmidhi** - Authentic hadith with commentary
• **Nasai** - Detailed sunnah collection
• **Ibn Majah** - Extensive hadith collection
• **Musnad Ahmad** - Largest hadith collection

**Example requests:**
• "show me Sahih Bukhari on prayer"
• "what does Abu Dawud say about eating"
• "give me Tirmidhi hadith on patience"

I have additional authentic sources on this topic. Here are your options:

**1. One Source at a Time (Recommended)**
• Say "one at a time" or "next source"
• Best for deep study and understanding
• I'll guide you through each source systematically

**2. All Sources at Once**
• Say "all at once" or "show me everything"
• Comprehensive overview of all available sources
• Good for getting the complete picture

**3. Specific Source**
• Say "show me Sahih Bukhari" or "give me Quran verses"
• Focus on particular collections or types of sources
• Useful for targeted research

**4. Continue with Current Topic**
• Ask follow-up questions about what I just showed you
• Explore specific aspects in more detail

**What would you prefer?** Just let me know your choice and I'll provide the sources accordingly."""
